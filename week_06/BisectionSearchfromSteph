sure, overall my code was slow but I had to do the whole thing on Sun as I am working 12+hours a day

def find(data, target):

    """Function to check for target word in data set. It is optimised by using the bisection search method.

    Important Note: Data set must be sorted lowest to highest for this function to work"""

    start = 0

    end = len(data) - 1



    while start <= end:

        # Next guess of target location is midpoint between start and end of list

        # Must round guess of the middle point to nearest integer for data list

        middle = int((start + end)/ 2)

        midpoint = data[middle]

        if midpoint > target:

            end = middle - 1

        elif midpoint < target:

            start = middle + 1

        else:

            return midpoint
